I'm sure most of you dont know what that means but I'm basically a taxi for the elderly/bedridden.  A lot of my job is treating/transporting people who have no other means to and from dialysis, dr's appointments, radiation, surgery etc.  You can imagine the mentality many of these people have.    I'll be honest, I steal your jokes.  I screenshot them and reuse them with these patients.  So many of them groan and smile and begrudgingly enjoy your jokes.  Often they get annoyed because they,  should have guessed the answer  and wrinkle their brow and spend minutes at the next joke just to hear the answer to,  what's blue and isnt very heavy at all .  I damn near cracked when someone said,  the sky , I mean, that's not wrong, right.  These people have everything in the world going against them, but everyone react the same to a good dad joke.    Anyway, these jokes all of you have blessed this sub have made a huge impact on not only my life, not only my patients lives, but the way I interact with people in general.

A Bird Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely NOT Avian Flu.  The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts.    However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws.  By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car.       MTA then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.  The Ornithological Behaviorist very quickly concluded the cause:  when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger.

Fast forward a few weeks to us being back home in Kansas City, MO where no beaches or seagulls are to be found.  My dad and I were running errands and found ourselves at the local Target, where in the parking lot I spotted dozens of white birds that looked eerily similar to the Seagulls I had learned about weeks before.     Dad, what're those.   I inquired   Oh, son those are called Parkinglotgulls.

The police investigated all the workers at the job site .  It looked like foul play.   The mason wasn’t a suspect.   He had a concrete alibi.   The night of the accident he said he was with his girlfriend.   She confirmed this.  There was a wall of evidence.  Consequently his alibi was rock solid and not just a facade.  There was damning evidence that it was the plumber.  They figured his alibi, that he was at the casino, wouldn’t hold water.   But cameras showed fluid betting all night.  This, obviously, threw a wrench in the investigation.   The investigators followed a lead to the electrician.  He had a shocking secret.   It seems the electrician had been charged with battery only months earlier.  But it was a dead end.   They looked at the HVAC installer, but his alibi was airtight.   Next, they tried to nail the Roofer, as he had been spouting off about the victim the day of the accident.   But the roofer had been hammered all day.   There was no way they could paint him as the cunning mastermind.    Then they saw the writing on the wall: the painter had both motive and opportunity.   He was seen canvassing the accident site a few strokes before midnight when the accident occurred.   The victim fell off a faulty ladder that was covered in finger paint.   It seems the victim and the painter had a few brush-ins before.

He loved his job.  Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.  He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.  Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.  He made it out, but a single person died.  Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.  He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.  When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.  After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.  The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened.  The man was perfectly fine.  \\xa0  Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.  Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.  Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.  Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.  The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.  For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.  After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.  The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.  \\xa0  Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.  And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back.  To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.  And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.  On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.  \\xa0   You know what.  No,  said the executioner.   I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed.  I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now.   Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.  The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed.

The widow, however, says that she always thought her husband looked his best in blue, and that she wants him in a blue suit.  She gives the mortician a blank check and says, 'I don't care what it costs, but please have my husband in a blue suit for the viewing. ' The woman returns the next day and to her delight, she finds her husband dressed in a gorgeous blue suit with a subtle chalk stripe; the suit fits him perfectly.  She says to the mortician, 'Whatever this cost, I'm very satisfied.  You did an excellent job and I'm very grateful.  How much did you spend.

Now this requires some explaining before I get to the joke.  I just completed my 55th theatre production - mostly community theatre; most designing and running sound, but I get on stage sometimes.  A decade or so ago, I came up with a terrible pun.  Told it, got groans, and promptly forgot about it.   A production or two later, someone said -  Hey, aren't you going to tell your joke.   It took a little prompting to remind me of it.  Once I was reminded, I told the joke - to more groans.   I enjoyed the groans so much - and was touched that someone remembered the joke that I'd forgotten.  So I did decide it was going to forevermore be: THE JOKE.   So the NEXT production, I started warning people that  The Joke  was coming.  One or two remembered the previous time I'd told it, and reacted -  Oh god.  Please no.    So now it has truly become a thing.  Every production I'm in, I start reminding people that The Joke is coming, and the reactions from those who know the joke really help set up the anticipation.   So finally it happens.  Most theatre productions I've been in run Fri-Sat-Sun performances.  And thus, as I explain, I can only tell The Joke after the last Friday night's performance ends, and before the last Saturday's performance begins.  It shifts if the days are different because The Joke depends on the number of remaining shows.   So, finally that time period comes, and I explain that I can only tell the joke during that time period, only the once per production - from auditions to strike - and that we're in that period of time.  which is known as.  the  cancer period .  AND would you like to know WHY this period of time is known as the  cancer period .   (at which point the tension for the punchline is usually quite palpable)   Because we have.  TUMOR.   (as I hold up two fingers).   This is usually followed by shouts to  GET OUT.   and threats of violence against my person.  hehehe  And the NEXT time, when I start warning that  The Joke  is coming, most of these groan  Oh god.  no.   and helps set it up for the next poor bunch of folks who haven't yet heard it <sep> :)\", \"Dejá vú As we were walking by a bunch of boats one was named  dejá vú  so of course I said  I feel like I've seen that boat before  and cue the groans from my family <sep> Edit: spelling\", 'Got my wife lasr night on the freeway There was a certain boy band playing at the Rose Bowl last night.

(I did not write this myself but thought it might belong here)  “Son, we need to have a chat about Internet Safety. ” I slowly crumpled down onto the floor next to him.  His laptop was open and he was playing Minecraft on a public server.  His eyes were locked into the action.  Comments scrolled down the side of the screen in a chat box.  “Son, can you stop your game for a minute. ”  He exited the world, closed the laptop, and looked up at me.   Dad, is this going to be another cheesy scary story.     Whhaaaat.   I faked hurt feelings for a second, and then grinned at him,  I thought you liked my cautionary tales.   He grew up listening to my stories about children who encountered witches, ghosts, werewolves, and trolls.  Like many generations of parents, I used scary stories to reinforce morals and teach lessons about safety.  Single dads like me should use all the parenting tools at their disposal.   He scrunched his face a little,  They were fine when I was six.  But now that I'm getting older, they don't scare me anymore.  They seem kinda silly.  If you are going to tell a story about the Internet, can you make it really, really scary. ” I squinted at him incredulously.  He folded his arms, “Dad.  I’m ten and I can handle it.     hmm… okay.  I’ll try.    I began, “Once upon a time, there was a boy named Colby…. ” His expression indicated that he wasn't impressed with the terror of the introduction.  He sighed deeply and settled in for one of Dad’s cheesy stories.  I continued.    Colby went online and joined several children's websites.  After a while, he started talking to other kids in-game and on the message boards.  He made friends with another ten year old boy named Helper23.  They liked the same video games and shows.  They laughed at each other's jokes.  They explored new games together.    After several months of friendship, Colby gave Helper23 six diamonds in a game they were playing.  This was a very generous gift.  Colby's birthday was coming up and Helper23 wanted to send him a cool present in real life.  Colby figured it wouldn't hurt to give Helper23 his home address - as long as he promised not to tell it to any strangers or grownups.  Helper23 swore he wouldn't tell anyone else, not even his own parents, and set about mailing the package.   I paused the story and asked my son,  Do you think that was a good idea. ” “No.   he said shaking his head vigorously.  In spite of himself, he was getting into the story.    Well neither did Colby.  Colby felt guilty about giving away his home address - and his guilt began to grow.  And grow.  By the time he put on his pajamas the next night, his guilt and fear were larger than anything else in his life.  He resolved to admit the truth to his parents.  The punishment would be steep, but it was worth it to have a clear conscience.  He squirmed in his bed as he waited for his parents to tuck him in.   My son knew the scary part was coming up.  In spite of his tough talk, he leaned forward wide-eyed.  I spoke quietly and deliberately.    He heard all the noises of the house.  The washing machine bounced around in the laundry room.  Branches scraped against the brick outside his room.  His baby brother cooed in the nursery.  And there were some other noises he couldn't.  quite.  pinpoint.  Finally, his dad’s footsteps echoed down the hall.  “Hey Dad. ” He called out nervously.  “I have something to tell you. ”   His dad stuck his head in the doorway at a weird angle.  In the darkness, his mouth didn't seem to move and the eyes were all wrong.   Yes, son  The voice was way off, too.   Are you okay, Dad.   The boy asked.   Uh-huh  sung the father in his strangely affected voice.  Colby pulled his covers up defensively.   Ummm.  Is Mom around.      Here I am.   Mom's head popped into the doorway below Dad's.  Her voice was an unnatural falsetto.   Were you about to tell us that you gave our home address to Helper23.  You shouldn't have done that.  We TOLD you never to give out personal information on the Internet.     She continued,  He wasn't really a kid.  He just pretended to be one.  Do you know what he did.  He came to our house, broke in, and murdered both of us.  Just so he could spend some time with you.     A fat man in a wet jacket emerged in the child's doorway holding the two severed heads.  Colby shrieked and gasped as the man dropped the heads on the ground, unsheathed his knife, and moved into the room to work on the boy.   My son screamed too.  He twisted his hands defensively over his face.  But we were just getting started with the story.   After several hours, the boy was almost dead and his screams had become whimpers.  The killer noticed the wailing of a baby in another room and removed his knife from Colby.  This was a special treat.  He had never murdered a baby before and was excited about the prospect.  Helper23 left Colby to die and followed the cries through the house like a homing beacon.   In the nursery, he walked to the crib, picked the baby up, and held it in his arms.  He moved towards the changing table to get a better look.  But as he held the baby, the crying died down.  The baby looked up and smiled.  Helper23 had never held a baby, but he gently bounced it in his arms like a pro.  He wiped his bloody hands on the blanket so he could stroke the baby's cheek,  Hey there, sweet little guy.   The beautiful rage of sadism melted into something warmer and softer.   He walked out of the nursery, took the baby home, named him William, and raised him as his very own.   After I finished the story, my son was visibly shaken.  Between ragged staccato breaths, he stammered,  But Dad, MY name's William.   I gave him a classic dad-wink and tousled his hair.   Of course it is, son.   William ran up the stairs to his bedroom in a fury of sobs.   But deep down <sep> I think he liked the story\", 'We were about to witness our first autopsy in medical school.

Phil had just graduated High School and was going to college to be a railroad conducter.  Unfortunately, he was horrible.  He failed half his classes, he barely knew what a train was, and he frequently peed on the railroad tracks.  Somehow, he managed to get a bachelor's degree in conducting.  After college, he went to a decent job at a railroad.  It had an average pay grade and everyone was relatively nice to him.  It was a nice stable job, so no one knew why, on the fateful day of October 13, 2017, he snapped and killed everyone on board.  He was detained and taken court, where he was almost immediately sentenced to death by the judge.  His personal security guard asked him,  What do you want for your last meal.   Phil replied,  I want a guava orange.   The guard was baffled.  She had no idea what the fuck a guava orange was, much less how to find one.  So, like anyone who doesn't know where to find something, she got one on eBay.  She brought it to Phil, who immediately wolfed it down.  She then escorted him to the electric chair, strapped him in, and flipped the switch.  Nothing happened.  Baffled by this odd occurrence, the guard said,  Well you've served your time, I guess you're free to go.   So Phil reintegrated to the world and found a new job.  This one was well paying and everyone there loved him, so everyone was even more baffled when he flipped out on his new co-workers.  He was returned to court, sentenced to death, and the same guard asked him,  What do you want for your last meal.   Phil said,  I'd like a guava orange.   It took the guard two months to track down a guava orange this time, but she finally found one in a Baghdad market stand.  She gave it to Phil, who wolfed it down and proceed to the electric chair.  The guard flipped the switch - and nothing.  The guard said,  I guess you're free again,  and released Phil into the world.  He immediately got an extremely high paying job, everyone there adored him, it was perfect.  At least, until he snapped yet again and killed everyone there.  The judge sentenced him to death again, and the guard asked him,  Let me guess, guava orange.   Phil nodded, and the guard set out on her quest.  It took her two years to find the very last guava orange, and when she brought it back Phil wolfed it down and sat in the chair.

There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.   He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.   He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.   Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.   He made it out, but a single person died.   Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.   He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.   When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.   After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.   The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.   The man was perfectly fine.   Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.   And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.   Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.   Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.   The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.   For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.   After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.   The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.   Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.   And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.   To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.   And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.   On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.    You know what.  No,  said the executioner.   I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed.  I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.    Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.   The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.

He designs everything himself, hires people to create models, and deduces that he can use old fashioned boating technology to increase shipping speeds by up to 350%.  This is obviously a great innovation, so he calls up a former Business professor from college and gets into contact with a manufacturer.  The manufacturer makes the man come in and present his design to the board of directors, so they schedule a meeting in two weeks.    At the meeting, the board is blown away.  The man’s charisma, design, and equations all point to a massive innovation in shipping.  The company is poised to make a huge profit.  Construction starts immediately.    On his flight back, the man happens to sits next to his old buddy from high school, Jimmy.  Jimmy tells the man that he has just blown the farming world wide open.  His new GMO potato produces five times as much energy and has been the talk of the world.  Jimmy says that all the news outlets have been reporting potatoes to be the next big superfood, and his design is poised to make him millions, if not billions of dollars.  Jimmy pitches the man for the entire plane ride, and convinced him.  They hop on the next flight back to visit the board of directors once again.  The board is shocked.  Both ideas stand to make billions of dollars for the company, but there is one slight problem.    The CEO says to the man, “we know you have these two ideas.  However, we can only allocate enough resources to make one of them profitable.  I recommend you take some time off and really decide which of these ideas you want our company to produce.  We can schedule a meeting in a few weeks if that works for you. ”  The man says right back to the CEO, “I’m going to take a walk and clear my head.  This is a big decision” and walks right out of the room.    Not even five seconds later the man comes back into the room and says “I’ve made my decision.  Let’s go with the shipping method. ” This shocks the CEO, who says “are you sure.

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.  He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.  Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.  He made it out, but a single person died.  Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.  He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.  When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.  After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.  The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened.  The man was perfectly fine.  Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.  Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.  Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.  Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.  The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.  For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.  After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.  The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.  Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.  And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back.  To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.  And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.  On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.   You know what.  No,  said the executioner.   I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed.  I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now.   Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.  The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed.  The executioner was speechless.  The man looked at the executioner and said,  Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it <sep> I'm just a bad conductor\", 'I bought my son a toy spider. Off.

He tells it to this day to any of my cousins, nephews, or any kids that happen to linger too long at the house when he's giving out candy.  It's a long one but I have always enjoyed it. *  Back when I was about your age, I went on a Halloween adventure.  There was an old abandoned house on our street where a series of grisly axe murders had taken place years before.  The house had never sold and was left vacant and was left to fall apart.  There was a local legend that if you went into the house on Halloween night, you'd be confronted by the ghost of the murderer himself, still looking for more victims to add to his terrifying story.    My friend Tom and I decided to go through with it one year.  Knowing everyone would be too terrified to go into the house, we snuck in easily on Halloween night.  The place was falling apart inside, the carpet was wet and moldy and the wallpaper was peeling off everywhere.  We headed down carefully to the basement down a set of creaky stairs.    At first we found nothing.  Just an empty creepy old house.  Suddenly we felt as if we were being watched.  I was looking through one of the rooms in the large basement when I suddenly heard Tom shriek.  I spun around and turned my flashlight and Tom was being chased by something, no *someone. * It looked like it was the murderer.  A crazed man with an axe.    We turned and tried to run anywhere.   We were in the basement but couldn't get up the stairs because we were blocked.  We ran into the side room which looked like it might have been the laundry years ago.  We locked the door and looked for a way out.  The only thing we could find was a small window that opened onto ground level.  As I climbed out I heard a pounding on the door.  I managed to wriggle my way through the window and turned around to help my friend Tom.  Panicking, he managed to get his top half through the window when I noticed the pounding stop.    Tom was stuck.  I kept trying to pull him up but I couldn't.  I pulled as hard as I could as Tom panicked and thrashed even more.  I thought something had him caught, but it was even worse.  The murderer had gotten behind him and was holding him back.  He was too strong for me to overcome and he was pulling Tom's leg <sep> *Just like I've been pulling yours this whole time\", \"Joke from my grandfather Person:  Well <sep> GF:  That's a deep subject\", 'Yesterday my wife told me ISIS and the Taliban declared a holy war against one another <sep> Jihad to be kidding me', \"what do you call a bee that's from America <sep> a USB\", 'I once tried to shred cheese with a knife <sep> But then I found something grater', \"I guess you could say reddit isn't very <sep> Victorious anymore\", \"What's a pirate say when he gets kicked in the groin <sep> Menards\", \"My dad dropped this one on me a while ago I'd been saving up change that I got from eating lunch at my university, and I had at least 20 dollars in coins.

Now Ivan and his family were dirt poor, in fact they were so poor, that they had to sell the cockroaches and rats they found in their hovel to make some spare change to to feed their many family members.  One day, Ivan decided it was time to travel to the United States to try and have a better life and miraculously he managed to get aboard a ship to the States.  Now his journey on this ship was miserable, he was down in the bowels of the ship, which was flooded with rats and feces, but he hunkered down and gave it his all to survive this terrible journey.  finally, one day he hears commotion above, they had arrived at last.  Ivan walks up to the topside of the old ship and sees the New York Harbor.  He stands there amazed seeing such a beautiful sight.  Ivan starts his life in New York but he doesn't have a significantly better life than the one he left behind.  Nobody is interested in hiring immigrants but eventually he lands himself a gig of selling old newspapers.  He would go through garbage cans to find old papers and would sell them to people in the poorer part of town.  He makes slightly more spare change, but not really enough to live a better life.  In his spare time, which he had plenty, he decides to start free diving in the bay.  He goes there each day, and started to get really good at it.  One day, an owner of a Circus spots him diving and is amazed at how good he is.  He decides to offer Ivan a job at his circus  doing performance diving.  Ivan eagerly accepts and begins his career as a circus member performing amazing high jumps into really small containers of water.  After a few months of doing this he suggests to the owner one amazing jump to wow everyone and put his circus on top of the entertainment world.  The owner contemplates this  and eventually agrees.  He  rents a ship much like the one Ivan arrived in and placed the smallest container yet.  The radio and tv crews, journalist all arrive to spectate the event of a lifetime.  The hour arrives and Ivan begins his climb up a massive lighthouse on the edge of the cliff, and the ship is positioned into place beneath him.  Ivan is very nervous but decides it's go time, and jumps from the massive lighthouse.  As Ivan falls, he takes perfect form heading straight towards his target.  As he dives a sudden wave pushes the ship ever slightly throwing off the careful alignment.  Ivan hits the deck and goes straight through the top of the ship.  The spectators all horrified, gasp and cry out wondering if he survived.  There is a dead silence and everyone has a grim look on their face but amazingly, Ivan emerges from the hole in the top of the ship.

It got a lot of groans, so I think it's great, if a bit long.   ---  I once lived near a small, simple town where there lived named Hugh.     Hugh was a very smart man stricken with a series of personal tragedies earlier in his life.  As a result, he moved to this small town and took a job in his local florist shop, relaxing the days away arranging flowers and trying not to think of times past.  Hugh grew to love working there.    One day, a disaster struck the town.  A small, single engine airplane crashed a block from Hugh's shop, killing those on the plane and setting fire to several buildings, both occupied and empty.     The impact ruptured a gas line, which ultimately exploded, creating a shock wave that caused part of the building next to the florist shop to collapse and trap several of Hugh's customers and co-workers inside.  The situation was desperate, as the shop would be burned to the ground at any moment.     Acting quickly, Hugh located the gas main, shutting it down.  Next, Hugh noticed a water storage tank nearby, and opened a release valve that suffocated the fire before it reached his beloved shop.     With the fire out, and the florist shop saved along with those trapped inside, Hugh was a hero.  The town presented him with a plaque in honor of his courageous deeds.  On this plaque was a detailed etching of a bear, and Hugh was touched because he loved bears.  But it was the words etched beneath that truly touched him <sep> Only Hugh could prevent florist fires\", 'Walking down at the beach the other day I heard a man screaming “HELP, SHARK, HELP ME PLEASE <sep> ” I just laughed to myself and thought, that sharks never gonna help him', \"One day, Canada is going to take of the entire world <sep> Then you'll all be sorry\", 'My dad just came in from trimming the trees. he was all bloody and scratched up.

The cause of death was vehicular impacts.   However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the birds beaks and claws.  By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that nearly 96% of the crows had been struck by trucks, while only 4% were car impacts.   The MTA then hired an Ornithological Behavourist to determine the reason for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills vs car kills.
